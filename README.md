# Poly-Differentiator
 Poly Differentiator is a Java application that showcases algorithmic thinking and mathematical problem-solving. It's designed for evaluating and differentiating user-inputted polynomials, utilizing complex algorithms to process and display these polynomials in an easily understandable format. 


Features:

Polynomial Input: Users can input the degree and coefficients of polynomials.
Evaluation and Differentiation: The program can evaluate polynomials at a given point and differentiate them.
String Representation: Polynomials are converted to a string format for easy understanding and visualization.

How to Use:

Run PolyDifferentiator.java.
Enter the degree and coefficients of the polynomial.
Specify a value 'k' to evaluate the polynomial at that point.
The program outputs the polynomial's string representation, evaluation at 'k', and its derivatives.
